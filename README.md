# Computer Vision for Drone Detection
Object detection for aerial vehicles (drones, helicopters, airplanes, etc) with bounding box prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset we used is available on Kaggle and Roboflow.

## Metrics and Evaluation
Using the following metrics/benchmarks, we'll be evaluating each model's ability to distinguish between aerial vehicle types and produce bounding boxes for them within the image:
- Mean Average Precision (mAP)
- Intersection over Union (IoU)

Alongside the metrics above, we'll be profiling the models to determine performance:
- Inference Latency
- Model Size
- Training Time
